King</big> was
born in Syracuse, New York in 1919.&nbsp;He grew up on Long Island
during the depression. While in high school, Harold got his first job
selling roasted coffee door to door. He later attended Cooper Union
University on a full scholarship. When World War II began, Harold
joined the Army Air Corps and began his training as a pilot. He quickly
rose through the ranks and would fly B-17’s and B-29’s until the war
ended.&nbsp; Harold’s stepfather, Arthur Woelfl, was the manager
for J.Aron &amp; Co.’s San Francisco office, and in 1946 he offered
Harold an entry level job there. Harold decided to pack up the family
and make the move across the country to California and thus began his
career in the coffee business. Harold worked for J.Aron for eleven
years until&nbsp;the end of 1957 when the company decided to close
its San Francisco office and consolidate its operations to New York and
New Orleans. Harold was offered a job in either location, but by then
he and his young family were firmly entrenched in California and so
Harold decided to start out on his own.<br>
<br>
<br>
On January 1st, 1958, Harold L. King &amp; Co. was born. Harold
persevered through some lean early years and gradually built the
business up as roasters got to know him as an honest and reliable
source for quality coffees in all grades. In the 70’s and early 80’s
there began to be a shift in the coffee business towards smaller
specialty roasters interested in higher quality beans. These roasters
needed a source for the higher qualities and the problem was that
buying in less than container loads was almost unheard of. One of these
early pioneers was a man called Alfred Peet. Alfred had been turned
down by many dealers who refused to break a container for him but
eventually he contacted Harold and they worked out an agreement to
deliver his coffee over time. It was the first time for each of them to
structure business in this way and it would prove to be the start of a
revolution and a key to the success of Peet’s Coffee and Harold L. King
&amp; Co. as well.<br>
<br>
Harold was intimately involved with the various coffee associations,
particularly the Pacific Coast Coffee Association, where he continually
served on committees and as its President in 1978. His son Robert
joined the company in 1973 and was followed by son John in 1984, both
of whom continue to run the company to this day.&nbsp; Harold
finally retired from the business at the age of 70 in June of 1989 but
sadly he would never get to enjoy much retirement as he passed away in
January of 1990 only 6 months later. &nbsp;<br>
Ask anyone who ever knew him; there was not a finer man in the coffee
business.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
